/* 
    Layout: Four On Top (With Banner logic?)
    The CSS read from 'styles/' was actually for a 6-column grid with 3 panels top, 3 panels bottom.
    The filename is "layout-four-on-top-with-banner-three-on-bottom-grid".
    BUT the CSS had 3 top, 3 bottom.
    I will reconstruct it to match the Name better if possible, or stick to the CSS logic if it was used.
    CSS logic:
    Top: 1a (1/3), 1b (3/4), 1c (4/6) -> 3 panels.
    Bot: 2a (1/3), 2b (3/4), 2c (4/6) -> 3 panels.
    
    This matches neither "Four on top" nor "Banner".
    I will leave the file structure from the CSS I found but use explicit syntax.
